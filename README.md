# Memory Game Project

Memory Game Project is a memory game entirely built in HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. It was made as one of the prerequisites for graduation on Udacity's Front End Web Developer Nanodegree.
The memory game consists on flipping and matching all the turned-down cards. Each couple of open cards are considered as a move. The objective of the game is to match all the cards as fast as possible.
